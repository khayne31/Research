create place holder to feed in data
//loop through thirty scans in random order
place holder for fireing rate(rest) (66x1199) (throw away last value)
place holder for change in firing rate(dr)(66x1199)
tf.constant for tr and identity matrix
weight matrix as a tf.variable(random intitalization)(66x66)(random vector length 66^2/2 -> run triangle method)(0 diagonal)
implement the equation
loss = tf.mean_squared_error(predicted, dr) + tf.norm(weight matrix* length_matrix)
use adam optimizer(set a learning rate)
run network
start a loop say 10000
	randomly select one of 30 runs (this is rest: sample(all_rest_scans)-> outputs one of them)
	calculate dr as difference between adjacent timepoints
	[my_weights, session_loss]= session.run([outputs = weight matrix, loss], [placeholder_name: value])
	1%100 == 0 print session_loss


plt.imshow(my_weights)
